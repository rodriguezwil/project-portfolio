# Lessons Learned â€“ Facility Launch

1. **Telecom lead time is non-negotiable**
   - Carriers over-promised delivery. Our contingency backup circuit kept us on track.

2. **Buildout contractors need daily visibility**
   - Slack + shared progress docs helped identify early-stage delays.

3. **Internal communication = smoother move-in**
   - A walkthrough and pre-handoff doc for the Ops team avoided confusion during the first week.

4. **Every item must be checked at physical level**
   - Even properly ordered gear might be delivered incorrectly. Tagging and serial tracking early saved hours.
